Warm up exercise 1
	1. Set up nginx in a virtual machine (virtualbox or whatever you prefer) or in Docker, such that:
		- Create a series of simple zero-filled objects of various sizes (10kb, 100kb, 1mb, 2mb, 8mb, 10mb).
		- These objects should be served when GET requests hit NGINX
	2. Install curl and experiment with making requests to your local nginx with curl.
	3. Download, compile, and run h2load (https://nghttp2.org/)
	4. Experiment with h2load requesting objects from nginx

Extra items if you finish the above:
	- Can you get nginx to listen on a unix socket?
	- How does the requests per second compare between running:
		- H2load against nginx on a TCP socket vs
		- H2load against nginx on a unix socket
	- If time permits, experiment with increasing the number of the threads for both nginx and h2load.
	- What is the maximum number of requests per second you can get? 

If possible, we'd love to have the deliverables for this warm-up project be a public github repo containing:
	- a script (or program or whatever you prefer) which sets the environment described above up, and runs curl or h2load
    - A README markdown file documenting the implementation, how to run it, and any tricky issues you ran into
